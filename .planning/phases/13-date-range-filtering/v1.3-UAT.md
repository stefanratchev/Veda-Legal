## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Tab bar visible on billing page
expected: Navigate to /billing. You should see a tab bar at the top with two tabs: "Ready to Bill" and "Service Descriptions". "Ready to Bill" should be selected by default.
result: pass

### 2. Ready to Bill tab content
expected: With "Ready to Bill" selected, the unbilled clients grid should be visible below the tabs — the same content that was previously on the billing page.
result: pass

### 3. Service Descriptions tab content
expected: Click "Service Descriptions" tab. The SD table should appear with a search input and a status filter dropdown (All/Draft/Finalized).
result: pass

### 4. Tab state persists via URL
expected: While on the "Service Descriptions" tab, check the URL — it should show ?tab=service-descriptions. Refresh the page. The same tab should remain active after reload.
result: pass

### 5. Default tab uses clean URL
expected: Click "Ready to Bill" tab. The URL should be /billing (no ?tab= query param). Refresh — "Ready to Bill" should still be selected.
result: pass

### 6. Date range picker on SD tab
expected: On the "Service Descriptions" tab, you should see a date range picker (dropdown/button) to the left of the search and status filters. It should show preset options: This Month, Last Month, All Time, and Custom Range.
result: pass

### 7. Default date range is This Month
expected: When you first open the Service Descriptions tab, the date range picker should default to "This Month" and only show service descriptions with a period start within the current month.
result: pass

### 8. Date range filtering works
expected: Change the date range to "Last Month" — the SD list should update to show only service descriptions from last month. Try "All Time" — all SDs should appear. If you have data across months, the counts should visibly change.
result: pass

### 9. Combined filters work together
expected: Set a date range (e.g., This Month) AND a status filter (e.g., Draft). Only service descriptions matching BOTH constraints should appear. Changing either filter should update results.
result: pass
