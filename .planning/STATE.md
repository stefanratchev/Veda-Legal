## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Revenue = rate x hours only (no SD/actual-billed integration)
- Revenue charts separate from hours charts (no dual-axis)
- No revenue in drill-down views (hours and activity patterns only)
- All entries in drill-down tables (remove 10-entry limit)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Null `topicId`/`topicName` entries must resolve to "Uncategorized" in all aggregations
- INTERNAL/MANAGEMENT clients (hourlyRate = null) must be excluded from revenue charts
- Entry tables will need pagination when removing the 10-entry limit (400+ rows possible per month)
